# Advent of Code 2025

Learning 🦀Rust🦀 through AoC 2025

## Usage

Each day's solution is implemented as a separate binary (`day01`, `day02`, and so on).

Run any day using:

```bash
cargo run --bin dayXX
```

**Note:** Puzzle inputs are not present in the repository. You must place your inputs in `inputs/dayXX.txt`.
